							<p>What is search engine optizimation?<br><br>

Search Engine Optimization is the process of improving the visibility of a website on organic "natural" or un-paid search engine result pages (SERPs), by incorporating search engine friendly elements into a website, The process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.

Guidelines on how to read a search Engine results page<br><br>


CHECK OUT THE BIG TWO: ORGANIC AND PAY PER CLICK. Search results are mostly dominated by two particular indexes: the organic or natural search results, and the PPC (Pay Per Click) search results. The organic-results index is created by searchbots. For instance, Google uses something called a googlebot to retrieve pages. It’s common to talk about searchbots as if somehow they wander around the Web, moving from page to page through links between the pages, collecting the pages, and sending them back to home base to be analyzed and indexed. The search results typically put ten results from the organic index into the search-results page, though, those results are often interspersed with other types of search results. (In some cases, in particular when adding local results to the page, the search engines may display a smaller number of organic-search results, perhaps seven or eight.) Today, the three major search engines all display PPC ads, ads that cost the advertiser nothing until someone clicks the ad, at which point the advertiser is charged instantly. . <br><br>

LOOK AT LOCAL RESULTS. There’s a relatively new type of result that has become incredibly important, with a huge presence in many search-results pages. Search Yahoo!, for instance, for the term personal injury attorney, and you may see something like the figure. These Local results can take up a lot of space, in particular in Google and Yahoo!, and thus are an important consideration for businesses that serve a particular geographic area. <br><br>

CHECK OUT SHOPPING RESULTS. It’s often not hard for the search engines to figure out when someone is quite likely searching for a product he may be interested in buying. If someone searches for shoes, it’s quite likely he’s interested in buying a pair, either offline (that’s where the Local results come in) or online (that’s where the Shopping results come in). On the other hand, if someone searches on shoe manufacturing victorian england, it’s unlikely that he’s in the market for a pair. The major search engines all maintain product indexes, totally separate from the organic or even the PPC indexes. <br><br>

STAY CURRENT WITH NEWS RESULTS. Another significant search-result component is the news results. If the search engines think News results might be useful to you, based on your search — search for obama or just about any country name, for instance — then you’ll see News results embedded into the results page. Again, these are from a completely different source; in fact, publishers have to apply to be included in the News results. (Google has an established process and takes many sites. Yahoo! and Bing are far more restrictive.<br><br>

VIEW VIDEO AND IMAGE RESULTS. You’ve almost certainly seen video and image results in the search engines. All three of the major search engines index Youtube.com (it’s owned by Google). But they index other sites, too, such as Vimeo.com, Vevo.com, and Metcafe.com. If you want to try getting your videos into the search results. <br><br>

GET FRIENDLY WITH SOCIAL RESULTS. Currently the three major search engines incorporate social-network results into the organic index; in other words, they index social-network sites just like any other site. There was a time when Google was indexing Twitter tweets and providing them in a little scrolling box embedded within the search results. Google no longer does that, at least at the time of writing. Perhaps the big social-networking news, though, as far as Google goes, is Google+, Google’s answer to Facebook. Have you noticed small author photos associated with search results, often from blogs? These little pictures are coming from Google+ accounts. Google is also personalizing your search results based on your Google+ relationships. If you’re searching Google while logged into your Google account, you may see personal results from your Google+ friends at the top of the page. <br><br>

COLLECT BITS AND PIECES. Finally, the search engines often embed little “bits and pieces” into the search results, data totally separate from these other indexes. For instance, search for sunrise 80209 in Google, and right at the top of the search results you’ll see the time of the next sunrise. Try searching for 173 pounds in usd, in any of the three major search engines, and you’ll see the current exchange rate, British pounds to U.S. dollars. All three also have calculators (try (5674374 / 231) + (12987 * 7), for instance). Looking for a flight? Or movie? Google and Bing will both provide flights, while Google will give you movie times. You may want to dig around sometime in your favorite search engine — try all the links and see where they go and read the Help pages to see what fancy tools are available. You may be amazed at what you find.<br><br>

								<h2>SEO and SEM</h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="img/seo1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p><br>IN YOUR OWN WORDS, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEO AND SEM?<br><br>
The difference between SEO and SEM is essentially that Search Engine Optimization is a piece of Search engine marketing or Search promoting as it is generally known. Both procedures point in expanding perceivability in web indexes. Web optimization is about enhancing your site to show signs of improvement rankings in the query items while SEM goes past SEO. It includes different techniques that can get you more web search tool guests like PPC advertising. As per Search Engine Land, Search Engine Marketing is "the way toward picking up site movement by buying advertisements on web indexes," while Search Engine Optimization is characterized as "the way toward getting activity from the free, natural, article or regular list items on web search tools."
<br><br>
Different SEO Strategies<br><br>
Domain Name Strategy 
The first and the most important decision you have to create is choosing the domain name. It has a great impact of the website’s success in nearly every area, included the SEO and the social media marketing (SMM). Linking Strategy

The landscape of SEO and link strategy is always changing, and today, the importance of building high-quality links has never been higher. The need to understand and implement high-quality campaigns is essential if you're going to compete and thrive online, and that isn't going to change any time soon. Keyword Strategy

Keyword Strategies are essential in developing for winning search engine marketing campaigns. Keyword Strategy must be involved selecting high performance keyword that is applicable traffic to the business. Using the best keyword strategies have a chance on highly relevant keywords, which is keyword is closely to the business.
Meta Description tags strategy

The meta description tag in HTML is the 160 character snippet used to summarize a web page’s content. Search engines sometimes use these snippets in search results to let visitors know what a page is about before they click on it. Crafting a readable, compelling description using important keywords can improve the rate of the page. Alt tags strategy

Alt tags (also known as alt attribute and alt description) is an image tags that provides a text alternative for search engines. Search Engine Indexing Strategy

Search engine indexing is the process of a search engine collecting and stores data. It is the search engine index that provides the results for search queries. Without the search engine index, the search engine would take time and effort every time the search query was initiated, as search engine would have to search not only every web page or piece of data that has to do.
<br><br>
IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE STRATEGIES? IF YES, WHICH STRATEGIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO IMPLEMENT? WHY?<br><br>

I would choose the domain name strategy. When starting a new website, one of the first and most important decisions you have to make is choosing a domain name. That choice will impact the website’s success in nearly every area, included search engine optimization (SEO) and social media marketing (SMM). Many SEO strategists would purchase exact match domains (EMDs), which are domains that exactly match the keyword phrase they are targeting. For example, if they want to rank for “buy green widgets” the person might purchase BuyGreenWidgets.com. EMDs offered two advantages..</p>

							<p>What is the difference between ON PAGE and OFF PAGE SEO?<br><br>

The difference between on page and off page SEO comes down to control. In on page SEO, you can target a search term through keyword research, create a page, and tweak the content for the best results. You have complete control over your optimization efforts. Off Page SEO is different. It relies more on promotion. These include link building, blogging, social media, and other off page SEO techniques to build awareness. Control is in the hands of your community.<br><br>

BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE FOLLOWING SEO GUIDES FOR OFF-PAGE TECHNIQUES<br><br>

Off page SEO refers to techniques that can be used to improve the position of a web site in the search engine results page (SERPs). Many people associate off-page SEO with link building but it is not only that. In general, off Page SEO has to do with promotion methods – beyond website design –for the purpose of ranking a website higher in the search results.<br><br>

							<p>" URL CANONICALIZATION "<br><br>
URl Cononicalization is important because its is the advancement in seo practices ,and as we all know that it is very difficult for a search engine to make a determination which value is correct if it comes across the same piece of content with two different URLs.<br><br>
" HYPERLINKING BEST PRACTICES "<br><br>
In making a link hyperlinks is certainly to the user to experiences that are connecting pages ,people and ideas with one click on it<br><br>
